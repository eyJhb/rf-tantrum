## Features
Can send basic packets using RF-433Mhz between Arduino/Raspberry Pi.
Read the code basically...

## Structure
The Raspberry Pi code is located in `rasp/go-home`,
and the Arduino code is located in `arduino/tantrum`.

The could should be fairly easy to read, but there is a lot that could be optimized.

## Final notes
There is a `.patch` file, which is was a work-in-progress of implementing a simple
xor encryption, when sending/receiving packets.
